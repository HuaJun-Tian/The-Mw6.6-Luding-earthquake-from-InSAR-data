# 2022 Mw 6.6 Luding earthquake sequence: a complex fault system inferred from InSAR displacement observations
This is a newly updated InSAR and corres[onding inversion results of the Mw6.6 Luding earthquake from ALOS2 ScanSAR, Stripmap and Sentinel-1 IW data. 

InSAR data format: Lon Lat displacements (rad)

Here are descriptions of some documents:

Coseismic deformation: 

20210909_20220922_strimap.txt is the coseismic deformation of the Mw6.6 Luding earthquake from ALOS-2 Stripmap data.

20211202_20220908_scansar.txt is the coseismic deformation of the Mw6.6 Luding earthquake from ALOS-2 ScanSAR data.

20220902_20220914_sentinel1.txt is the coseismic deformation of the Mw6.6 Luding earthquake from Sentinel-1 IW data.

Postseismic deformation:

20220922_20230323_stripmap.txt is the postseismic deformation after the Mw6.6 Luding earthquake from ALOS-2 Stripmap data.

Inversion result:

slip_luding_coseismic_by_one_fault.dat is the coseismic slip distribution caused by the Moxi fault.

slip_luding_coseismic_by_two_fault.dat is the coseismic slip distribution caused by the Moxi and effective normal fault.

slip_luding_postseismic.dat is the postseismic slip distribution caused by the effective normal fault.
